Description: NetworkManager configuration for Debathena workstations
 On older releases, this package configures your computer to connect
 to the "CAMPUS-AIR" wireless network on boot, which permits you to log in to
 network accounts from the initial login screen.  On newer releases,
 it provides a NetworkManager applet on the login screen, which the
 user can use to configure network themselves.
